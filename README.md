Wide Neural Network:

This is a prototype implementation of a Wide Neural Network. Details on the architecture will be added soon. 
The modules are written in Python and only use Numpy. 

Completed: 
Network initialization
Network Forward
Evaluate gradients - weights and v_in, v_board done. 
Softmax 
Softmax Loss and derivative

To Do: 
Complete gradient implementation for biases
Unit testing
Train on mnist digit classification
